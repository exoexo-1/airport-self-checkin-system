# Airport Self Check-In Machine

This Python-based program simulates an airport self-check-in machine, enabling passengers to check in for their flights, select seats, and generate boarding passes and bag tags. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming and user interaction through terminal inputs.

## Features

- **Flight Confirmation**: Verifies flight details using a preloaded flight database.
- **Seat Selection**: Allows passengers to choose their seat from available options.
- **Bag Check-In**: Option to check in baggage and generate unique bag tags.
- **Boarding Pass Generation**: Prints a personalized boarding pass for the passenger.
- **Interactive Terminal Interface**: Easy-to-use prompts for user interaction.

## Usage

1. **Start the Program**:
   Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python self-check-in.py
   ```

2. **Follow the Prompts**:
   - Activate the kiosk by typing `START` or `ACTIVATE KIOSK`.
   - Enter your flight confirmation number.
   - Choose whether to check in baggage.
   - Select your seat and generate your boarding pass.

3. **Output**:
   - A boarding pass and optional bag tag will be displayed in the terminal.

## Code Highlights

- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - `AirportSelfCheckInMachine`: A class encapsulating the entire check-in process.
  - Methods include `check_flight_confirmation`, `print_boarding_pass`, and `print_bag_tag`.

- **Flight Database**:
  A preloaded dictionary containing flight details like flight number, destination, departure time, and seat map.

- **Interactive Seat Selection**:
  Ensures only available seats can be selected, dynamically updating the seat map.

## Example Output

**Boarding Pass**:
```
-----------------------------------
| Boarding Pass                    |
-----------------------------------
| Flight Number: ABC123            |
| Passenger Name: John Doe         |
| Seat Number: A1                  |
-----------------------------------
```

**Bag Tag**:
```
-----------------------------------
| Bag Tag                          |
-----------------------------------
| Flight Number: ABC123            |
| Passenger Name: John Doe         |
| Bag ID: Bag1                     |
-----------------------------------
```
